<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p class="  item-intro text-muted">Urbieta Oil is South Florida's premier wholesale and retail distributor of petroleum and alternative fuel products. Urbieta produces, analyzes, and stores data from several different sources for 100+
points of sale per day. Each point of sale is recorded in a custom spreadsheet template and emailed to a central office for processing. The data is then extracted, transformed, and consolidated for posterior analytic reports.</p>

<h2>Problem</h2>
<p class="lead">Urbieta’s methodology for moving data is is a bottleneck on the company’s daily high-volume data activities. A more robust, real-time, automated workflow is necessary for the company’s continued
growth. The company's leadership seeks quicker access to information order to make decisions faster. Some of the issues with the current methodology are:
<ul>
    <li>Difficult process to consolidate historical information.</li>
    <li>Cumbersome to perform data analysis.</li>
    <li>No realtime, multi-user access to the data.</li>
    <li>No automated triggers, notifications, or alerts provided.</li>
    <li>Template version modification is limited.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<hr class="featurette-divider">
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p class="lead">After reviewing Urbieta’s workflow processes and IT Department policies Atkloud decided to allocated/deploy a dedicated server to run the Atkloud application.
Urbieta’s original spreadsheet templates (design, formulas, formats, etc) uploaded into the Atkloud software for continued use in a controlled and centralized location. Users were assigned with the
correct permissions in each template. Using the Atkloud data modeling tool, Atkloud defined and created a relationship between the Urbieta’s templates and a database. All new data is now stored in the secure, centralized database.</p>
<hr class="featurette-divider">
<h2>Advantages</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Fast deployment. Atkloud used Urbieta's original spreadsheet as the user input form.</li>
    <li>Remote Access. The users can access their data using any smartdevice.</li>
    <li>Centralize information.</li>
    <li>Realtime Reporting.</li>
    <li>Personalize Dashboard for groups or users.</li>
    <li>Granular permission for every object in the application.</li>
    <li>End users are not responsible for any installation. No extra spreadsheet licenses fee needed.</li>
    <li>Multiple level of alert notifications (e-mail, sms, internal chat, logs)</li>
    <li>No culture shock. Final users are able to enter data in the the original templates they are familiar with.</li>
</ul>
<p class="lead">After several months in production, without any interruption and smooth transition, atkloud provides flexibility and quick response to Urbieta's operational demands with the capacity to expand workload and automation tasks while focusing on daily and long-term analysis.</p>
